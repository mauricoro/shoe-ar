## Common Problems
My foot is not being detected? Why can't I see the shoe model on my screen?

Try moving to an area with better lighting, for both the AR scene and Foot Detector works best under optimal lighting conditions.

What will happen if a shoe is not available for AR Try-on?

You will be sent back to the shoe details after receiving a message that the file is missing or broken. We try to keep up to date with any errors.

Will the shoe follow my foot?

Due to Android Studios AR limitations, no. It is a work in progress, however for now you have the unique experience of placing your shoe anywhere you'd like. A common feature is being able to place it next to a set of clothes to try out different outfit combinations.
